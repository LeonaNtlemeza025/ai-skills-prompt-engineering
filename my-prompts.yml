ai_response: Subject: Request for Additional Information – WhatsApp Project Requirement Analysis

Dear [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

As part of the initial requirement analysis for the new WhatsApp project—particularly the concierge solution for submitting claims on-site—I’ve reviewed the available documentation and recent discussions. To ensure a thorough and accurate analysis, I would appreciate your assistance in clarifying a few key areas:

Scope and Objectives: Could you confirm the specific goals and expected outcomes for the WhatsApp integration? This will help align the analysis with business priorities.

User Scenarios: Are there defined user journeys or scenarios for how clients will interact with the WhatsApp solution, especially in the context of motor accident claims?

Technical Constraints: Are there any known limitations or dependencies (e.g., backend systems, message polling mechanisms) that we should factor into the analysis?

Stakeholder Expectations: If there are particular metrics or success criteria that stakeholders are focused on, please share those so we can incorporate them into the evaluation.

Your input will be invaluable in shaping a comprehensive and actionable requirement specification. Please let me know a convenient time if you'd prefer to discuss this in a quick call.

Thank you for your support.

Warm regards,
Leona Ntlemeza
